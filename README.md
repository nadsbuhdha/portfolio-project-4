### Colour Schemes

During the inital design phase, I researched a variety of music review based websites. A common theme across the websites is their commitment to netrual and simplified colour schemes. I adapted this approach when designing my site. The reasoning for this choice is that when users upload album artwork, it can  be in a variety of different colours and styles which could potentially clash with an over exhuberant colour scheme design choice. Keeping a sleek, schematic colour scheme minimises any potential clashes with user uploaded image content and keeps the site asthetically pleasing for the user. White, black and sublte grey on the footer and header were used to keep the colour schemes formularized. 

### Fonts

Andada Pro was chosen at the primary font choice throughout the website. After experimenting with a variety of fonts, Andada Pro provided sleek serif typography which complimented the overall professional, yet calm asthetic of the website. San-serif was chosen as a backup font, should Andada Pro fail. 


# Features
